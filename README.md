# Memenumbers DApp Web UI

Who knows, maybe we will prove the Collatz Conjecture while we are at this.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```sh
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Hosting

Currently using github pages.  To manually deploy:

```sh
yarn build
yarn export 
yarn deploy
```

Gotchas:
- Need custom ```next.config.js``` ```assetPrefix``` and ```basePath``` (and possible nav/link hacks)
- Need empty .nojekyll file in the generated ```out``` path when pushing to ```gh-pages``` branch
- Reference: [nextjs issue](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/3335)
