All Numbers are unique (there can be no duplicates) in our collection. The entire project is on-chain and relies on just the Ethereum chain.</p><p>There are two parts to playing the MemeNumbers game. The first part is the minting contract we call the Number Generator where up to 8 random numbers can be minted.</p><p>The second part is the Burn Operator contract. This contract allows any MemeNumber owner to take two Number NFTs and perform one operation to create a new Number. In other words, insert two NFTs, get one back. The new resulting Number is unique and a part of the MemeNumber set, meaning that if that Number already exists, then the minting contract cannot create that Number and no one else can use the operator contract to have that Number. It’s like a game of musical chairs.</p><h3>How does it work?</h3><p>Every one (1) hour, everyday, until the end of Ethereum, a set of numbers will be randomly generated and auctioned off from the remaining available number-space. We are using a Dutch auction mechanism to reduce the gas wars typically associated with a drop.</p><h3>Why is this project important?</h3><p>Primitives are a very useful class of NFTs and contracts in the crypto world. They allow anyone to build derivatives without permission while inheriting the properties of the primitive. We believe that there are lots more primitives that can be built for Ethereum and it will enable more creativity with less complexity. If Money Legos exist, then it implies the existence of many other Legos. Meme Numbers are a class of number Legos.</p><h3>Can I keep Operating numbers?</h3><p>Yes. All you need to do is pay for gas. We do not charge to burn Numbers. You can keep burning any two Numbers as long as the resulting number does not already exist. If the resulting number exists, the Burn Operator will not allow you to mint the burn. You will need both burner numbers in the same wallet. The newly minted number will be minted into the same wallet.</p><h3>What is the cost of minting a number?</h3><p>The numbers are priced using a Dutch auction where the price is reduced over the 1 hour auction period. After an hour, if no one has won the auction, the price will fall to zero and stay there until someone mints for free. Just pay gas. By using the Dutch auction method, we hope to avoid the gas wars associated with many NFT projects.</p><h3>How are the numbers chosen?</h3><p>The possible range of numbers are 1 through 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639936. That’s a lot of numbers. The numbers are randomly generated using the blockhash as the seed. Based on probability, numbers with a single digit are the rarest, followed by two digits, then three, and so on. We have excluded 0 since it breaks things and possibly creates a black hole if not used properly.</p><p>The randomizer can be seen in the<!-- --> <a href="https://github.com/NonFungibleSequences/memenumbers-contract/blob/1342b64af6d72c0f5c4cf4b62cc57785c7d2c458/src/MemeNumbers.sol#L68" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contract</a>.</p><h3>Why did you create this?</h3><p>We are passionate about creating “primitives” for the Ethereum ecosystem. Primitives are basic building blocks of a metaverse that others can use to create a complex, and rich world. We set out to design:</p><ol><li>a 100% Ethereum-chain-only primitive that</li><li>minimizes the chance of gas wars for fair distribution and</li><li>allows for everyone to have fun and build on top for all eternity</li></ol><p>We hope you enjoy our project. This is our love letter to Ethereum and this amazing community.</p><h2>The People and Community</h2><h3>Who are the people behind this project?</h3><p>The four people behind MemeNumbers are two developers, a community manager, and an operations person. We wanted to call this the Memenacci Project, but we could not get clarity on how to spell it, so we went with MemeNumbers instead.</p><ul><li><a href="https://twitter.com/benhuh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Huh.eth</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/dt_mugen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Denis(dt665m)</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/nicwn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicwn</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/shazow" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shazow</a></li></ul><h3>What experience do you have creating crypto projects?</h3><p>Shazow was one of the two devs behind the<!-- --> <a href="https://thousandetherhomepage.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thousand Ether Homepage</a>, which launched in 2017 prior to the ERC-721 standard being adopted.

He had led the creation of LEGO Ideas. Left the tech scene after becoming a dad and worked in the education NGO sector.

He has been working on projects to make game assets into NFTs ever since the early days of Ethereum.</p><h3>What’s the roadmap?</h3><p>Our roadmap adheres to the “primitive” philosophy: Bottom-up like the Loot Project, instead of top-down. Therefore, beyond this launch, we have not committed to any further development. We would love to and we have lots of ideas though, but we’re most looking forward to what others build. We want you to participate on the face value of this project so far.</p><h2>Project Details</h2><h3>Is the contract audited or verified?</h3><p>The contracts are verified on Etherscan, but not audited. We provide no warranties or guarantees on these contracts. Please do your research before aping into any NFT project. Having said that, we strive to be fair, transparent, and only make promises we can keep. Please visit our Discord and ask us any questions!</p><h3>Why are you using an auction and not a bonding curve?</h3><p>We&#x27;re using a Dutch auction process to maximize fair distribution and minimize the gas wars. The Dutch auction is essential for the premise of releasing sequence batches, otherwise there will just be a dumb land grab if we let people mint however many numbers they want as long as they&#x27;re first and pay highest gas. That&#x27;s not fair. And it subtracts 90% of the fun.</p><h3>Why is there no artwork with the NFT?</h3><p>Since we’re creating a primitive, we have purposefully decided to keep the visual art to a minimum. It is possible for us or other projects to do so in the future. We consider our art to be this project itself and the logic behind it.</p><h3>Are you a DAO?</h3><p>No. We’re just a team of four people sitting in front of Etherscan, wondering when our transaction will be mined. We have started and joined DAOs and we’d be happy to see others form DAOs around this project.</p><h2>Project Economics</h2><h3>Why will MemeNumbers be valuable?</h3><p>All MemeNumbers are unique, so there can only be one “420,” or “1,” or “999999999,” or whatever string of numbers you deem valuable. Since the Number Generator issues numbers at random, it’s very unlikely it will generate the exact number you want. That’s where your skills using the Burn Operator comes in. The value you create is one part luck, two parts galaxy brain.</p><h3>If I mint a MemeNumber, can I resell it like any other NFT?</h3><p>Yes. Absolutely. You can use OpenSea, Rarible, or any site that supports ERC-721 trading. To encourage trading, we decided not to charge for royalties from the sale of MemeNumbers on secondary markets.</p><h3>How many MemeNumbers will there be?</h3><p>The size of the MemeNumbers collection depends on how quickly the auctions are closing, how many are being minted when an auction is won, and how many numbers are being burned. Therefore, we cannot predict the number of MemeNumbers.</p><h3>Do you have a token (ERC-20)?</h3><p>No. You are free to create one and airdrop them to our community. If you do, you must:<!-- --> </p><ol><li>Promise not to rug them</li><li>make it clear we did not create them.</li></ol><h2>Technical Details</h2><h3>Can I see the metadata?</h3><p>Yes. The entire NFT consists of a single piece of metadata — the number itself — which acts as the token ID.</p><h3>Why can’t I go negative?</h3><p>We believe in unity and positivity. But that’s not why you can’t go negative. The ERC-721 standard does not support negative token IDs.</p><h3>Can you speed up or slow down the minting?</h3><p>Nope. The minting should continue long after we have left this mortal coil and our consciousnesses have been deployed in the big blockchain in the sky.</p><h3>What can I build on top of MemeNumbers?</h3><p>Anything you want. Please enjoy this primitive.</p><h3>Can the number distribution algorithm be changed?</h3><p>The number distribution algorithm is the heart and soul of MemeNumbers. We want to make it as immutable and transparent as possible. We are proud to have made the decision to make it on-chain and non-upgradeable.</p><h2>Credits</h2><h3>Inspirations</h3><p>The team would like to thank the following projects, their communities, and the people behind them for inspiring us. We believe you are pioneering an amazing world of art and code.</p><ul><li>Nouns.wtf</li><li>Loot Project</li></ul></div></div></div><div class="Layout__Container-sc-1f1biq9-0 Layout__Navigation-sc-1f1biq9-1 Layout__Footer-sc-1f1biq9-2 cJRGuW crlgUw dARcun"><a href="https://discord.gg/EgA3TvxYTv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="Layout__NavItem-sc-1f1biq9-3 Layout__FooterNavItem-sc-1f1biq9-4 cMCmGQ hMUQwu">Discord</a><a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x98afe7a8d28bbc88dcf41f8e06d97c74958a47dc#code" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="Layout__NavItem-sc-1f1biq9-3 Layout__FooterNavItem-sc-1f1biq9-4 cMCmGQ hMUQwu">Contract</a><a href="https://www.github.com/NonFungibleSequences" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="Layout__NavItem-sc-1f1biq9-3 Layout__FooterNavItem-sc-1f1biq9-4 cMCmGQ hMUQwu">Github</a></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/faq","query":{},"buildId":"current","assetPrefix":"/memenumbers-ui","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
