                <Question>What is MemeNumbers?</Question>
                <p>
                    MemeNumbers is a game where wit and speed are the keys to
                    owning a one-of-a-kind NFT.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We generate up to eight random Numbers to be sold in Dutch
                    auctions that last for one hour. Auction starts at Ξ5 (Eth)
                    and ends at Ξ0.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyone can get a Number, anyone can sell a Number. Selling
                    Numbers are royalty FREE! (We don’t take a cut.) If you own
                    two or more Numbers, you can do math with them to create a
                    new Number!
                </p>

                <Question>Is this a NFT?</Question>
                <p>
                    Yes, MemeNumbers are standard ERC-721 on the Ethereum
                    blockchain.
                </p>

                <Question>But where’s the art?</Question>
                <p>
                    MemeNumbers are not typical Jpegs. It’s in a class called
                    “Primitives”, which can be used as building blocks to other
                    NFTs and the Metaverse!
                </p>
                <p>
                    The art of MemeNumbers is not in its drawing. It’s in the
                    project itself - the logic behind it, its attributes, its
                    actual data on the blockchain; the sum of it all is
                    considered the “art”.
                </p>

                <Question>How are the numbers chosen?</Question>
                <p>
                    The numbers are randomly generated using the blockhash as
                    the seed. The possible range of numbers are 0 through
                    Uint255. You can read the code for the number distribution
                    algorithm on the{' '}

                </p>

                <Question>
                    Can the number distribution algorithm be changed?
                </Question>
                <p>
                    Nope. The number distribution algorithm is the heart and
                    soul of MemeNumbers. We made it as immutable and transparent
                    as possible. The algorithm is on chain and non-upgradeable.
                </p>

                <Question>How long will MemeNumbers be up?</Question>
                <p>
                    Forever! Everything is on-chain so as long as the Ethereum
                    blockchain exists, MemeNumbers will exist.
                </p>

                <Question>OK, how do I get some MemeNumbers?</Question>
                <p>
                    You can get MemeNumbers in one of three ways. By winning at
                    the <StyledLink href="/">Dutch Auction</StyledLink>, by

                    The Dutch auction starts from Ξ5 (Eth), dropping down to
                    Ξ0.0 linearly in one hour. When you mint, you pay the exact
                    price at the time of minting. If no one mints after an hour
                    then the price will sit at Ξ0 until someone mint (for
                    free!). If you’d rather mint directly on the contract, you
